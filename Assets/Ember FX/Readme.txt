URP Upgrade
==============

The Upgrades folder contains a unitypackage that will allow you to upgrade the project to URP. Double-click it and choose Import. To revert to Standard, re-import the asset.

If you have any visual artifacts in URP, make sure you are using the latest version of URP in the Package Manager.
